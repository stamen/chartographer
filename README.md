## Develop

2.  `yarn install`
3.  `yarn dev`

### Loading style by default in development

To ease development you can load a default style in development by putting one in `public/style.json`, which is ignored by git. Once you do, in development mode you will not need to drag and drop a style in order to view it.

This app is currently deployed using GitHub Pages.

1.  `yarn build`
